- One message per slide
- Use contrast to draw attention to a object
- Use size to draw attention to a object
- Avoid using sentences, so attention can still remain with the presenter
- Use dark backgrounds, so attention can still remain with the presenter
- No more than 6 objects per slide; the difference between seeing objects as 1 message, compared to seeing each object as an indivaul message.

## What validation can I put in place to prevent this?

- Make all text the same size; If the user thinks a object should be bigger/small than another object on the same slide, it should probably be on its own slide
- Check/validate the contrast between the background and the text colour; give the user a warning and gage
- Only allow dark backgrounds
- Check/validate the word/charactor count
